# Example Implementations

The driving force to develop this project is automated bots for Nintendo Switch Pokémon games.

Refer to the [Wiki](https://github.com/kwsch/SysBot.NET/wiki) for more details on the supported Pokémon features.

- Configuration of program settings is performed in-app and is saved as a local json file.

## SysBot.Pokemon.Discord:
- Discord interface for remotely interacting with the WinForms GUI.
- Provide a discord login token and the Roles that are allowed to interact with your bots.
- Commands are provided to manage & join the distribution queue.

## SysBot.Pokemon.Twitch:
- Twitch.tv interface for remotely announcing when the distribution starts.
- Provide a Twitch login token, username, and channel for login.

## SysBot.Pokemon.YouTube:
- YouTube.com interface for remotely announcing when the distribution starts.
- Provide a YouTube login ClientID, ClientSecret, and ChannelID for login.

Uses [Discord.Net](https://github.com/discord-net/Discord.Net), [TwitchLib](https://github.com/TwitchLib/TwitchLib), and [StreamingClientLibary](https://github.com/SaviorXTanren/StreamingClientLibrary) as a dependency via Nuget.

## Other Dependencies
Pokémon API logic is provided by [PKHeX](https://github.com/kwsch/PKHeX/), and template generation is provided by [Auto-Legality Mod](https://github.com/architdate/PKHeX-Plugins/). Current template generation uses [@santacrab2](https://www.github.com/santacrab2)'s [Auto-Legality Mod fork](https://github.com/santacrab2/PKHeX-Plugins).

# Disclaimer
SysBot.NET performs online trading and raid hosting in a manner that is unlike real human behavior; no human will be doing these continuously without end. Keep in mind that abnormal behavior can be detected, tracked, and penalized at any time by the game developer. Use this program at your own risk.
